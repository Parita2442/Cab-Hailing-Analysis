# Cab-Hailing-Analysis
BA 775 Project

Uber and Lyftâ€™s fluctuating prices are like a black box, with consumers in the dark about the pricing algorithm. Hence, our primary goal for this project was to gain insights into ride-sharing services' pricing dynamics and their correlation with various factors including distance, weather conditions, time of day, and more. We also wanted to investigate if there were any patterns in the way users use ride-hailing apps and how this may affect the demand and popularity of corresponding services.
